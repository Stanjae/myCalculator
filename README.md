# React Calculator App

## Overview

This is a simple web application built with React.js that functions as a calculator. The application leverages the `math.js` library for advanced mathematical operations and `Tailwind CSS` for a clean and responsive user interface.

## Features

- **Basic Calculator Functions**: Perform standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- **Advanced Calculations**: Utilize advanced mathematical functions provided by the `math.js` library.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a user-friendly and responsive design, suitable for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- math.js
- Tailwind CSS

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-calculator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd react-calculator
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the calculator. Use the calculator interface to perform basic and advanced calculations.

## Project Structure

- **src/components**: Contains React components for building the calculator UI.
- **src/utils**: Utility functions for handling mathematical calculations and interactions with the `math.js` library.

## Calculator Interface

The calculator interface provides a standard set of buttons for numbers (0-9), basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), and additional functions such as parentheses and advanced mathematical operations.

1. **Basic Arithmetic**: Use the standard buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Advanced Operations**: Explore advanced mathematical functions provided by `math.js`, such as square root, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, and more.

3. **Responsive Design**: The calculator is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience on desktop and mobile devices.
